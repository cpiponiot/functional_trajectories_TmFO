\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Tropical forests are crucial for most global ecological cycles. They
hold xx\% of the total carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and are
estimated to store xx Gg C.yr\(^{-1}\), about xx\% of total
anthropogenic carbon emissions, playing a major role in climate change
mitigation (ref IPCC xxx). Tropical forests act as precipitation relays
through vegetation transpiration, acting as a buffer against droughts in
adjacent regions {[}some numbers{]} (refs: ({\textbf{???}}), etc).
Tropical forests also harbour xx\% of known terrestial species. The
future of tropical forests will thus largely determine the functioning
of Earth ecosystems and, in turn, human well-being.

The future of tropical forests is however highly uncertain: since the
mid-twentieth century, humans have triggered rapid changes in the global
environment ({\textbf{???}}). Tropical forests are being clearcut for
agricultural or mining purposes at unprecedented rates, and most
remaining forests have or will be heavily impacted by human activities
({\textbf{???}}). Disturbances such as droughts, fires, selective
logging, or hunting, are increasing in intensity and frequency
({\textbf{???}}). Human disturbances modify forest functioning, but the
intensity, direction and duration of these changes are still largely
unknown.

One predomininat human activity in tropical forest is the selective
logging of a few merchantable trees: xxx Mha are selectively logged
every year in the tropics, and XXx\% of tropical forests have been
logged at least once. Because selective logging focuses on a few
individual trees (typically 5-10 trees per ha), XXX\% of the forest
cover is maintenained after logging operations. Damage to the forest is
concentrated in infrastructure (roads and skid trails to get machines in
then logs out of the forest), and in logging gaps created by tree
felling.

Disturbances such as selective logging can affect the composition and
dynamics of tropical forests: change the global functioning of the
ecosystem. // forest recovery after a disturbance -\textgreater{} carbon

notion of resilience: measure of how well an ecosystem can cope with
disturbances and return to its original (pre-disturbance) state. 2
components = change in state (or resistance to a disturbance) + return
time (Hodgson, McDonald, and Hosken 2015). {[}introduce our conceptual
framework, disturbance intensity{]}

functional traits = xxx (definition). characterisation of ecosystem
functioning \(\rightarrow\) importance to understand how they are
affected by disturbances. functional strategies and tradeoffs in

Amazon = largest tropical forest biome on Earth (50\% of tropical

gradients that control the dynamics of old-growth forests: dryness

growth, and a tree mortality gradient (SW-NE) (Johnson et al. 2016) due
to lower soil stability (C. a. Quesada et al. 2012) and higher frequency
of windstorms (Espírito-Santo et al. 2014) in the southwestern part of
Amazonia.

Here we assess the resistance of 4 functional traits (namely wood
density, seed mass, specific leaf area and maximum tree diameter) to
selective logging in Amazonia. We calibrate an original Bayesian
hierarchical model with data from xxx permanent forest plots from 12
long-term experimental sites. Our research questions are: (i) how is the
functional composition of Amazonian forests affected by disturbances
such as selective logging? (ii) are some functional traits more
resistant than others? (iii) does the functional resistance vary across
Amazonia, and what factors could explain those variations?

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Study sites}\label{study-sites}

Our study includes data from twelve long-term (8--30 year) experimental
forest sites located in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield (Figure
XXX). All sites are located in tropical forests with mean annual
precipitation \(\geq\) 1000 mm. Sites were logged once and permanent
forest plots (xx-xx ha per site) were censused at least once before and
at least twice after logging. For each site, we extracted the climatic
water deficit from Chave et al. ({\textbf{???}}), at a 30 arc-seconds
resolution. {[}kriging -\textgreater{} smort{]}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  environmental covariates: table? maps in SM?
\end{itemize}

For sites with plots \(\leq\) 1 ha, data from those with the same
treatment 113 were aggregated to mitigate the small plot effect on the
variation in density of large trees.

\subsection{Functional trait data
compilation}\label{functional-trait-data-compilation}

Traits chosen:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(DBH95\): DBH 95th percentile (per species) as a proxy of the stature
\item
  \(logSeedMass\): median seed mass (log-transformed) as a proxy of the
  dispersal strategy
\item
  \(SLA\): median specific leaf area, as a proxy of the assimilation
  strategy and leaf economic spectrum
\item
  \(WD\): median wood density, as a proxy of growth rate and mechanical
  support
\end{itemize}

retrieved from xxx and estimated for each individual: by species or
genus or plot mean (see explanation package BIOMASS)

Selective logging typically targets big trees (DBH \(\geq\) 40 cm)
belonging to a small group of species with commercial value.Those
species usually have particular functional trait values, such as large
maximum diameters and high wood density {[}xx{]}. The functional
composition of the biggest trees is thus artificially modified because
of the selectivity of harvests. Because we are more interested in the
indirect effects of selective logging on the functional composition,
i.e.~the functional changes induced by tree felling and canopy openings,
we excluded trees with DBH \textgreater{} 35 cm from the analysis.

Mean weighted trait: (weighted with biomass)

\begin{equation}  
MWT_{k,c,p,s} = \frac{\sum_{i \in I_{c,p,s}}(T_{k,i}\cdot agb_i)}{\sum_{i \in I_{c,p,s}}(agb_i)}
\end{equation}

with \(T_{k,i}\) the value of trait \(k\) (either \(DBH95\),
\(logSeedMass\), \(SLA\), or \(WD\)) for individual tree \(i\),
\(agb_i\) the aboveground biomass of individual tree \(i\), and
\(I_{c,p,s}\) all live trees with DBH \(\geq\) 10 cm and \(\leq\) 35 cm
at census \(c\) in plot \(p\) in site \(s\).

The aboveground biomass of each individual was estimated using the
package BIOMASS (Réjou-Méchain et al. 2017) (details xx).

\subsection{Model calibration}\label{model-calibration}

For each trait \(k\), the mean biomass-weighted trait of small trees
(MWT) trajectory at census \(c\) in plot \(p\) in site \(s\) was
modelled as:

\begin{equation}  
dMWT_{k,c,p,s} = \frac{MWT_{k,c,p,s} - MWT0_{k,p,s}}{T0_{k,p,s}} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( \mu_{k,c,p,s}\text{ , } \left(\frac{\sigma_k}{size_p}\right)^2\right)
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}  
\mu_{k,c,p,s} = \Delta_{k,p,s} \cdot \left( \frac{t_c}{tmax_{k,p,s}} \cdot exp\left(1-\frac{t_c}{tmax_{k,p,s}}\right) \right)^{\theta_{k,p,s}}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(c\) the census, and \(t_c\) the time since logging (in years) at
  census \(c\),
\item
  \(T0_{k,p,s}\) the pre-logging trait value of the community in plot
  \(p\) in site \(s\).
\item
  \(\Delta_{k,p,s}\) is the maximum value (relative to the final value)
  of the hump that follows logging and the creation of logging gaps.
  \(\Delta_{k,p,s} \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu_{\Delta ks}, \sigma_{\Delta}^2)\),
  with \(\mu_{\Delta ks}\) and \(\sigma_{\Delta}\) are respectively the
  mean and standard deviation of \(\Delta\) for trait \(k\) in site
  \(s\).
\item
  \(tmax_{k,p,s}\) is the time when the maximum value of the hump is
  reached. \(tmax_{k,p} = 0\) for control plots and in logged plots
  \(tmax_{k,p} \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu m_{ k}, \sigma m^2)\) where
  \(\mu m_{k}\) and \(\sigma m\) are respectively the mean and standard
  deviation of \(tmax\) for trait \(k\).
\item
  \(\theta_k\) is a shape parameter that controls the width of the hump;
  when it increases, the hump is narrower.
\item
  \(size_p\) is the size of plot \(p\)
\end{itemize}

\centering
\includegraphics{rticle_tmfo_functional_files/figure-latex/method_example-1.pdf}
\caption{Example of predicted relative MWT change (dMWT) after a
disturbance.}
\end{figure}

\(\Delta_{k,p,s}\) is the maximum change of trait \(k\) after the
disturbance: its absolute value is expected to increase with disturbance
intensity. We thus modelled it as:

\begin{equation} 
\Delta_{k,p,s} = loss_p \cdot (\lambda_{0,k} + \sum \lambda_{m,k} Cov_{m,s}) 
\end{equation}

\(loss_p\) is the relative aboveground biomass loss after logging in
plot \(p\), as a proxy of the disturbance intensity; it is estimated as
the difference between the pre-logging aboveground biomass and the
minimum biomass in the first 4 years after logging, divided by the
pre-logging aboveground biomass. \(Cov_{m,s}\) is the value of covariate
\(m\) (either the mortality rate or the climatic water deficit) in site
\(s\).

\subsection{Predictions}\label{predictions}

-\textgreater{} final prediction maps resolution =\textgreater{} cwd
values (xx resolution) aggregated to a 1 degree grid, average value.

are randomly selected in their distribution and predictions of maximum
relative CWD change (\(\Delta\)) are estimated.
